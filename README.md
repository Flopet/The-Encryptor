# __The-Encryptor__
  Python program used to quickly and easily encrypt and decrypt files.

# __!!!WARNING!!!__
  Be careful not to overwrite or delete your `.keyfile` after encryption!!!!
  If you lose the `.keyfile` that was used to encrypt the files, they CANNOT be decrypted. (as far as i know 😉)
